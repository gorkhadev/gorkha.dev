## Important Points to Remember

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and describes how the web page should be displayed (look).

- Describes how elements should be rendered on screen, paper, speech, or other media.

- Three types or ways to add CSS to web page:
  - Inline CSS
  - Internal CSS
  - External CSS

- Inline CSS: Used to apply a unique style for a single element.

- Internal CSS: Include CSS rules for a single HTML page and has an effect on that page. It is defined in the `<head>` section using `<style>` element.

- External CSS: The CSS rules are defined in a separate file with the extension .css. And, each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file (.css) using the `<link>` element, inside the `<head>` section.

- A comment is used to explain the code which might be helpful for self or for others. And, they are not displayed in the browser.

## Important points to remember

- A CSS selector is used to select the HTML element(s) that we can style.

- Common CSS categories:
  - Simple selectors (name, id, class)
  - Combinator selectors (relation between two selectors): Descendant selector (space), Child selector(`>`), Normal sibling selector(`~`), Adjacent sibling selector(`+`)
  - Pseudo-class selectors (based on specific states)
  - Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
  - Attribute selectors (based on an attribute or attribute value)

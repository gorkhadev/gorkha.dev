# Interactive Ruby

Interactive Ruby Shell (`IRB` or `irb`) is a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby.
As mentioned, we presume the abbreviation `irb` comes from the fact that the filename extension for Ruby is `.rb`.

The program is launched from a command line and _allows the execution of Ruby statements giving an immediate response, letting us experiment interactively_.
It features command history, line editing capabilities, and job control, and is able to communicate directly as a shell script over the Internet and interact with a live server.

**NOTE:** `irb` was developed by Keiju Ishitsuka.

## Try it yourself

In your terminal or shell, just type following
```shell
irb
```

Then, start playing with Ruby statements as
```irb
>> "Hello World"
>> 120
>> 15/2
>> 15.0/2
```

**NOTE:** This was just a intro of the `IRB`. We will play with it more in the later sections.
